# RaheelAhmed_Hit_it
 
Introduction: 
The game is about the UFO that appears on the screen, you need to hit with a limited missile through the spaceship. If the missile hit UFO the score point add and if the missile is hit to UFO it got stuck with it if another missile hit with the stuck missile the game is over for the player. Press spacebar for fire.
Reason: 
The Reason is that I made the game like Hill Climbing game in my Game development course with Navttc, although it got the same mechanism of the car’s wheel like in the hill climbing game with wooden platform that knives throw hit game. 

Hurdles: 
The main hurdle of the game is that the UFO movement although is got the same mechanism as the car’s wheel of the Hill Climbing game but at some point, I got stuck like colliding with the UFO with missile and let it stick.
 
Incomplete Task: 
The incomplete task of the game is that the after the game over screen is shown the game is still running after the game is over because system compatibility.

My code is well intended and have comments.
